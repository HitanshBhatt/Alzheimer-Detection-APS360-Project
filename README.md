## üßæ Overview

Alzheimer's is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Early detection can help with better disease management. This project applies state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to identify stages of Alzheimer's from brain MRI scans.

The pipeline involves:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- One-hot encoding of labels.
- CNN training from scratch.
- Transfer learning with ResNet152.
- Evaluation using confusion matrix and accuracy metrics.
- Hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation for performance improvements.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled brain MRI scans categorized into:

- **Mild Demented**
- **Moderate Demented**
- **Non-Demented**
- **Very Mild Demented**

### Sources:
The dataset used is publicly available from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar413/alzheimer-mri-dataset) or similar repositories. Ensure compliance with the dataset's license if used elsewhere.

## üß† Approach

We started with a basic CNN architecture and achieved ~81% validation accuracy. Upon applying transfer learning using **ResNet152**, our accuracy improved significantly.

### Techniques Used:
- **Data Augmentation**
- **Transfer Learning (ResNet152)**
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis**
- **Optimization with Adam**
- **Model Evaluation with Validation Split**

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

### 1. Baseline CNN:
- 3 convolutional layers
- MaxPooling + ReLU
- Dense + Softmax
- Accuracy: ~85% (after tuning)

### 2. Transfer Learning with ResNet152:
- Removed dropout for better convergence
- Fine-tuned ResNet layers
- Added custom classification head
- **Final Accuracy:** ‚úÖ **99% on training**, **~95% on validation**
